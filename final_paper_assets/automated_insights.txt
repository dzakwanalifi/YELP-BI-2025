=== AUTOMATED ANALYSIS INSIGHTS ===

1. SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY (MGWR):
- Jakarta Pusat Sensitivity to Production Distance: -0.427
- Cirebon Sensitivity to Production Distance: -0.375
-> CONCLUSION: Jakarta is significantly more affected by physical distance/logistics friction than Cirebon.

2. SHOCK PROPAGATION (VAR/IRF):
- Peak Impact Week: Week 2
- Peak Impact Value: -0.310
-> CONCLUSION: There is a 2-week lag before a shock in Bandung fully hits Jakarta. This is the 'Golden Time' for intervention.

3. PRICE ASYMMETRY (NARDL):
- Transmission of Price Increase (Rocket): 0.258
- Transmission of Price Decrease (Feather): 0.286
-> CONCLUSION: Price decreases transmit FASTER than increases. This suggests 'Panic Selling' behavior due to lack of storage.
