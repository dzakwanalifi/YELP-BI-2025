STATISTICAL ASSUMPTION TESTS & DIAGNOSTICS
==========================================

1. NORMALITY TEST (Shapiro-Wilk) on Price Distribution
   Statistic=0.9391, p-value=0.0000
   Result: Data is NOT Gaussian (Reject H0) -> Suggests use of Robust Regression or Log-Transform

2. STATIONARITY TEST (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) on Price Series
   Test on Bandung Price Series:
   ADF Statistic: -3.3095
   p-value: 0.0145
   Result: Series is Stationary (Reject H0)

3. MULTICOLLINEARITY TEST (VIF)
              feature       VIF
0             rain_mm  1.022636
1  connectivity_index  1.022636
2           intercept  5.701931
   Interpretation: VIF < 5 indicates no severe multicollinearity.
