FIGURE 2 ANALYSIS: POLICY CLUSTERS
==================================
Cluster Breakdown:
- Efficient/Stable: 5 cities
- Inefficiency (High Price, High Infra): 3 cities
- Structural Gap (High Price, Low Infra): 2 cities

RED ZONE (Priority for Infrastructure/PSBI): Cirebon, Tasikmalaya
ORANGE ZONE (Priority for Market Ops/GNPIP): Bandung, Depok, Jakarta Pusat
Insight: Red zones lack physical supply chain nodes, causing high prices. Orange zones have infrastructure but suffer from market inefficiencies.
